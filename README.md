- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amorg7208
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in expanding my knowledge base in Java. I have a background in emergency healthcare as a Paramedic and I am branching into the world of Data Analytics.
- ðŸŒ± I successfully completed U.C. Berkeley's Data Analytics Bootcamp in November 2022. This bootcamp highlights the foundations of VBA, Python, Matplotlib, APIs, SQL, ETL, Web Scraping with HTML/CSS, Javascript, R, Statistics, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning and Deep Learning Neural Networks.
- :books: I have an Associates degree from Chemeketa Community College in Emergency Medicine. However, I am on a journey to challenge myself and change careers. I am currently enrolled at the University of Washington, majoring in Informatics.
